# Loan-Risk-Prediction-ML
This ML project predicts loan risk using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression models. The code, implemented in Python, includes data preprocessing, model training, and user-friendly predictions. Evaluate and compare model performances for effective loan risk assessment.

Overview:
This repository contains a Python project for predicting loan risk using machine learning. The code utilizes three models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and user-friendly predictions.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and scale features for model training.
Model Training: Implement Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression models.
User-Friendly Predictions: Allow users to input details for individual loan applicants and receive risk predictions.

Getting Started:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-risk-prediction.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script: python loan_prediction.py

Usage:
Follow the prompts to input applicant details for personalized predictions.
Explore model evaluation metrics for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression.
